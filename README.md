# W4111-Project-Template

## Introduction

Donald Ferguson's section of W4111 - Introduction to Databases in the Department of
Computer Science at Columbia University has 5 homework assignments. Part of each assignment
is an implementation task. At the end of the semester, completing the homework assignments
results in the student completing a small, representative database and application project.

Sections of W4111 - Introduction to Databases have two tracks:
1. Programming
2. Non-programming

The HW and projects for both tracks have a common core for essential database and application
concepts. There are tracks specific extensions to the core.

## Application

### Overview

| __Project High Level Architecture__ |

Overly simplistically, there are two primary types of applications that use databases:
1. Interactive, operational systems that enable users to create, read, update and
delete information.
2. Decision support applications that enable users to query and analyze data to produce
reports, information, etc. that enables them to make strategy, planning, ... ... decisions.

The programming tracks builds an interactive, operational web application. The
non-programming track builds a simple decision support application. W4111 is a database course,
not a data science course. So, the emphasis of the project is [data engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering).

The preceding figure is a high-level, logical architecture diagram for a system combining
both an operational application and a decision support application. During the semester, 
subsections below will provide an overview of the components.

### Components

#### User Interface

There are two user interface components/systems:
1. Operational UI:
